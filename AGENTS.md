# Multi-Agent System Blueprint  

## Overview  
Describe the purpose and architecture of the multi-agent system. Outline the roles of each agent (developer agent, tester, reviewer, researcher, etc.), their personalities and responsibilities.  

## Agent Descriptions  
- **Name**: Description including capabilities, boundaries, tools, etc.  
- ... (List each agent in detail)  

## Capabilities & Boundaries  
Explain what each agent can and cannot do. Provide guidelines on tool usage, error handling, and fallback strategies.  

## Message Passing & Coordination  
Define the messaging protocol between agents (e.g., JSON-RPC-like messages). Include any schema definitions, token budgets, and context sharing strategies.  

## State Management  
Specify how agents should store and retrieve state (vector store, key-value store, or in-memory). Discuss persistence, caching, and version control if relevant.  

## Prompt Conventions  
Provide standard prompting patterns, including instructions for chain-of-thought handling, asynchronous tasks, and error recovery.  

## Extensibility  
Outline how to add new agents or tools, along with checklists for integration and testing.  

## Diagrams  
Include architecture diagrams or ASCII art to visualize the agent interactions.
